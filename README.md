This code was compiled by three students, in order to review Motion for React JS. 

The bulk of the code was created by "M", from a prior project on creating an image gallery using Vite with a backend and front end.
The buttons were created by "S". 
The animation of the big image was created by "M" using Motion, and the animation on the thumbnails was created by me, "A". 

We created it to be client-side only, as we only wanted a sort quick demo with Motion. We were collating our views and opinions on it, and you don't know if you actually like something unless you try it.
